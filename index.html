			<section>Debugging a Node.js process
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> Node.js process acting funny, need to debug it.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Start the node process with either --inspect or --inspect-brk and then open
					chrome://inspect in Chrome.</section>
				<section><img src="gifs/nodeDebugger.gif"/></section>
				<section><i class="far fa-comment"></i> Why not the debugger in my IDE?</section>
			</section>
			<section>Fuzzy find
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> It takes so long to find the specific file I want to fiddle with in the sources tab.
				</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> crtl-p, type the filename (or portion thereof).</section>
				<section><img src="gifs/fuzzyFind.gif"/></section>
			</section>
			<section>DOM breakpoints
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> UI is changing but I have no idea where from.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Right click the element, or parent of the element that is being modified, in the
					elements inspect tab of CDT and add dom breakpoints</section>
				<section><img src="gifs/domBreakpoint.gif"/></section>
				<section><i class="far fa-comment"></i> Call stack will almost always have jquery at the very top, but further down should be your
					culprit.</section>
			</section>
			<section>inspect element
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I have this jQuery thing that points to an element, but I want to see it in the
					elements tab so I can fiddle with it (set dom breakpoints, inspect parents, etc)</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Unwrap the dom element from jquery with $.get(). This will give you back an
					HTMLElement (or an array of them), which you can right click in the console and "show in elements",
					as well as directly set dom breakpoints.</section>
			</section>
			<section>save to global
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> This variable is named something different than what the source maps say and I need to
					fiddle with it in the console</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Right click the variable as it appears in the source map, click "save to global".
				</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I need to fiddle with this value of this large object and I don't want to have to type
					all the pathing out</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Right click, save to global!</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I need to compare these two values from different times the same breakpoint has been
					hit</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Right click, save to global!</section>
			</section>
			<section>conditional breakpoints
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I need to break at this specific point, but this is a hot path and gets hit a zillion
				times. I only care about one specific call!</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Right click the breakpoint, click edit, add a condition. When that condition evaluates
				truthy, the breakpoint will pause the debugger.</section>
			</section>
			<section>request breakpoints
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I need to fiddle with a specific request</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Set an XHR/Fetch breakpoint. In sources, on the right, scroll down to XHR/Request
				breakpoints.</section>
			</section>
			<section>block requests
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I need to see how the application behaves if this specific request fails</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Block the request via the network tab. Find the request, right click, "block request url"</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-comment"></i> This will block the request URL between reloads, so the block must be removed at some point. If a
				request is blocked, a "request blocking" tab will show up next to the embedded console.</section>
			</section>
			<section>source maps and edit in place
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I want to make a small change and see its effect but it takes 10 minutes to build the
				application, reload my browser, etc etc.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Turn off source maps by going to settings in CDT, under sources, uncheck "source maps". Now,
				open the file you want to modify in the sources tab of CDT. Make your changes, and save. The next time
				Chrome executes that path, it will use your modified code.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-comment"></i> Chrome DevTools chokes and dies if you do this with an absurdly large file. Think bundled code (sometimes we
				incorrectly refer to that as "minified" code).</section>
			</section>
			<section>loading modules in the console
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I want to kick around this specific module and see how it behaves.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Load the module in the console with require and attach it to window,
				`require(['path/to/the/module'], module => window.myModule = module);`</section>
			</section>
			<section>console.trace and events
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> This event handler (or function, or method) gets invoked but I have no idea where from</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Put a console.trace call at the top of the method. Chrome will spit out a stack trace in the
				console. Alternatively setting a breakpoint and looking at the call stack will accomplish the same
				thing, however only one at a time and it can be more difficult to compare differing stack traces.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I want to see what events this Backbone/Marionette thing emits when I do stuff with it.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> theThing.on('all', console.trace), will spit out the event name, any values passed along
				with it, and a stack trace to give an example of what caused that event</section>
			</section>
			<section>styling on the fly
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> It takes so long to wait for builds/reload/navigation/etc just to fiddle with styling</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Add rules to styles tab in the elements tab by clicking the little plus icon. Just like
				writing vanilla CSS, you put in the selector and then the values.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-comment"></i> It is possible to style individual elements and therefore you will not have to define a selector. While this is good to nailing down desired values, it hides the complexity involved in ensuring a selector would actually apply to the element. It is worth it, after desired values are identified, to take a second and write a rule that will be applied.</section>
			</section>
			<section>computed styles
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I have no idea why this element has this specific value for this specific css property</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Hover over the style in the computed style tab on the right of the elements window. It will
				tell you the specific rule that set the value. You can then move over to the rules tab and disable that given rule and see what it reverts to etc</section>
			</section>
			<section>identifying memory leaks
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> This application becomes slow over time (or even just dies).</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Use the memory tools to check for memory leaks. Not going to go into detail here, this is a
				topic unto itself, just want you aware that it exists.</section>
