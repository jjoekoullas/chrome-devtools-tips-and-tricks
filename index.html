			<section>Fuzzy find
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> It takes so long to find the specific file I want to fiddle
					with in the sources tab.
				</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> crtl-p, type the filename (or portion thereof).</section>
				<section><img src="gifs/fuzzyFind.gif" /></section>

			<section>DOM breakpoints
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> UI is changing but I have no idea where from.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Right click the element, or parent of the element that is
					being modified, in the
					elements inspect tab of CDT and add dom breakpoints</section>

					all the pathing out</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Right click, save to global!</section>

					hit</section>

			<section>conditional breakpoints
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I need to break at this specific point, but this is a hot
					path and gets hit a zillion
					times. I only care about one specific call!</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Right click the breakpoint, click edit, add a condition. When
					that condition evaluates
					truthy, the breakpoint will pause the debugger.</section>

					right click, "block request url"</section>
				<section><img src="gifs/requestBlocking.gif"></section>
				<section><i class="far fa-comment"></i> This will block the request URL between reloads, so the block

			<section>source maps and edit in place
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> Trying small changes requires a long build, reload, and
					navigate cycle. I want to check my small changes quickly.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Turn off source maps by going to settings in CDT, under
					sources, uncheck "source maps". Now, open the file you want to modify in the sources tab of CDT.
					Make your changes, and save. The next time Chrmtme executes that path, it will use your modified
					code.</section>

				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> This event handler (or function, or method) gets invoked but
					I have no idea where from</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Put a console.trace call at the top of the method. Chrome
					will spit out a stack trace in the console. Alternatively setting a breakpoint and looking at the
					call stack will accomplish the same thing, however only one at a time and it can be more difficult
					to compare differing stack traces.
				</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I want to see what events this Backbone/Marionette thing
					emits when I do stuff with it.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> theThing.on('all', console.trace), will spit out the event
					name, any values passed along with it, and a stack trace to give an example of what caused that
					event</section>

			<section>styling on the fly
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> It takes so long to wait for builds/reload/navigation/etc
					just to fiddle with styling</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Add rules to styles tab in the elements tab by clicking the
					little plus icon. Just like
					writing vanilla CSS, you put in the selector and then the values.</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-comment"></i> It is possible to style individual elements and therefore you
					will not have to define a selector. While this is good to nailing down desired values, it hides the
					complexity involved in ensuring a selector would actually apply to the element. It is worth it,
					after desired values are identified, to take a second and write a rule that will be applied.

			<section>computed styles
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> I have no idea why this element has this specific value for
					this specific css property</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Hover over the style in the computed style tab on the right
					of the elements window. It will
					tell you the specific rule that set the value. You can then move over to the rules tab and disable
					that given rule and see what it reverts to etc</section>

			<section>identifying memory leaks
				<section><i class="far fa-frown-open"></i> This application becomes slow over time (or even just dies).
				</section>
				<section><i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> Use the memory tools to check for memory leaks. Not going to
					go into detail here, this is a topic unto itself, just be aware that it exists.</section>
